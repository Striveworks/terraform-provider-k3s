## Description

Manage your [k3s](https://k3s.io) clusters with terraform. Much of this provider is a reimplementation of [k3s-ansible](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-ansible) into terraform
resources so you can manage you k3s clusters together with your cloud provider of choice (or baremetal). This provider is cloud agnostic, but is tested on Openstack.

## Usage

We only guarantee unit testing on the 5 most recent bug minor versions of terraform.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.5"

  required_providers {
    k3s = {
      source  = "striveworks/k3s"
      version = ">= 0.0.4"
    }
  }
}
```
